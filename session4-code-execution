# Session 4 – What Happens When Code Runs?

## Code → Execution Flow

- Code (Swift, Python)
- Compiler/Interpreter
- Machine Code
- CPU runs it
- Output appears

## Processes

- OS creates a process for the code
- Process gets memory, time, and I/O access
- Process ends when done

## Codex / AI

- AI models generate code
- Optional simulation or execution
- Often done in the cloud, not on your device

## Reflection

Running code is more than just hitting play — it creates a secure environment (a process) that the OS manages.
