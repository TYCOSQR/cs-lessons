# Session 8 – Branching Strategy & AI Collaboration

## Why Branching Matters with AI
- Keeps `main` stable
- Helps trace changes
- Enables safe testing before merging

## Suggested Workflow

1. Create a branch per task or prompt
2. Prompt Codex or use Copilot to generate code
3. Review, test, and edit manually if needed
4. Commit with clear message
5. Open PR and merge once ready

## Branch Naming Tips

- `feature/[name]` → for new features
- `bugfix/[name]` → for fixes
- `refactor/[name]` → for cleanup work

## Traceability Tip

- Use `[copilot]` or `[ai]` in commit messages if helpful
- Or track in session notes which parts were AI-generated
