# Day 3 – Anatomy of a Computer System

## Layered Model

- **User Interface** → Apps, web pages, commands
- **Application** → Swift, Python, JS programs
- **Operating System** → iOS, macOS
- **Kernel & Drivers** → Process management, file system
- **Hardware** → CPU, RAM, SSD, GPU

## Why It Matters for Compliance

| Layer | Risk/Concern |
|-------|--------------|
| UI | Data exposure |
| App | Encryption failures |
| OS | Logging and patching |
| Kernel | Privilege escalation |
| Hardware | Physical access |

## Reflection

Every layer introduces new challenges and new protection needs.
